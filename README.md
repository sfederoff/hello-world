# hello-world
First repository for training

This is a step in the guide section advising the trainee to make a change in ReadMe.md from the branch name Readme-edits.
I am working on this until my next meeting.

So I made a mistake and changed this master. This allowed me to find out how to delete a branch and how to create yet another one. I observed that as I created another one, it copied my master exactly - including the change I made that I meant for my first readme-edit.

So now I am actually making a change to readme-edit2 as instructed.
